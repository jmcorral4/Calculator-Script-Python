Learning to use Python and Visual Studio Code

I broke down each part of the script into a way that I could understand it so that I knew what each input was looking for. Defining each function sets the stage and prevents the user from dividing by zero. The issue I came across when running the script was that it would close or go into the base terminal again once you completed the function. If I chose to add 1+1 then I would get my answer of 2 and was then forced to run the script again to try some other function to test. Visual Studio Code is a big help because it will break it down and explain why the statement needs to be added in that spot for it to work. I asked the AI "how can I loop this so that I don't constantly have to run the script?". The results was to add *while True:* before the print of operations. I also had to add the choice option of ending the loop so that the only answer wasn't Alt+F4. I'd say overall the experience will come from repetition but using Copilot really cuts down the time in finding an answer that can explain it in various levels of technique so that I can make correlations or understand it in an analogy.
